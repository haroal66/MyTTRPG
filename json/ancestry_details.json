Although each ethnic group shares common physical characteristics among many of its people, the way these express in individuals varies widely. Due to the Vorin “right of travel,” international relations, and diasporas born of conflict, most nations have some degree of ethnic diversity among citizens.\n\nHumans may belong to any of the cultures of Roshar, defined by selecting your character‘s cultural expertises.",
	"1": "Singers are the indigenous population of Roshar, though this knowledge was suppressed by the humans and lost for many Desolations. Singers can change forms by bonding spren during highstorms, altering the appearance and functions of their bodies. Their intellectual and emotional capacities are equal to those of humans—but unlike humans, whose abilities generally remain constant, singer forms have the remarkable ability to temporarily amplify some abilities while others lie dormant.\n\nMost singers have either black or white skin, accented with swirls of red, and hairstrands in a hue of orange or red. Singers also have protective carapace that covers parts of their bodies. Certain forms have more substantial carapace, acting as biological armor. When a singer takes on a new form, it can influence their physicality, aspects of their personality, and their access (or lack thereof) to certain rhythms.\n\nDepending on the era of your campaign, a singer character may belong to the Listener culture, or may have expertise in a culture from living in human-ruled lands. Like humans, singers may take any cultural expertise to reflect the cultures that shaped them."
